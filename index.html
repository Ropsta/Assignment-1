                <p> <h3>Assalamualaikum,</h3>I am a student who lives in Bangalore city with my family. All my friends are from the city too. Like many people who are residents of the town, my family also has migrated from North India to come and settle here. I did my schooling in 12th in a school in the city.

                Now I’m doing my bachelor’s in the town.There are many things I have to learn and want to learn. The first thing that I want to learn is cooking. The number of things I can make in the kitchen is limited. However, while making those things, I realize the happiness and satisfaction are get from cooking. One of the cuisines I want to learn correctly is Mexican. It’s a cuisine that I have started loving, and knowing how to cook dishes in the kitchen will make me happy.
